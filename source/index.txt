What is MongoDB?
----------------

MongoDB is a document-oriented, operational database built from the ground up as an alternative to the relational database for modern applications.  

Unlike relational databases, MongoDB allows developers to store rich JSON-like documents that map naturally to the objects they use in their code.

For example, to model user objects in an application, a relational model would require multiple tables for what could be elegantly stored in MongoDB as this:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      firstname: "Bob",
      lastname: "Smith",
      email: "bob@smith.com",
      address: {
         street: "100 Main St",
         city: "Anytown",
         state: "MO",
         zip: "11111"
      }
   }

And retrieved with queries such as this:

.. code-block:: sh

   users.find({address.zip : "11111"})

MongoDB also offers:

  - Strong consistency with ACID transactions.
  - Modern additional built-in query capabilities such as geo search, lexical search, and vector search.
  - Serverless horizontal scaling with geo-aware fault tolerance across all major clouds.
  - Security primitives that allow MongoDB to operate in the most demanding of enterprise environments.
